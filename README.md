# Lazy Split bill React App

The aim of this project is for people who are too lazy to calculate their dining bills with friends or family. 
Although this project is very simple, it helps me to solid my React foundation of using different types of hooks and components. 
Basically, most of the main hooks in React have been used in this project. This is a very good practise for me to revise my React basic knowledge.

Tools that I have used in this project: React
